# Java Arrays
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to
  by a common name.
- [[Example question 1:::Example answer 1]]
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).

## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form: type[] arrayName;]]
- ex: int[] myData;
- [[This is another question  ::: this is the answer]]

- The above [[only creates a reference]] to an array object, but [[no array has
  actually been created yet]].

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];]]
- ex: myData = new int[100];

- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- [[numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not
  modifiable once instantiated.]]
